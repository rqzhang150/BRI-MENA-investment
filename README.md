In the inaugural year of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s presidency, he announced Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s ambitious $1 trillion infrastructure and investment project that aims seek to strengthen the connections between Chinese and other Eurasian economies [(Broder)](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre2019012500). While BRI embodies China’s increased economic engagement with the global economy. Xi’s presidency was otherwise characterized as politically repressive, including crackdowns on human rights lawyers, labor rights activists, and various civil society organizations [(Human Rights Watch)](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/17/china-xi-doubles-down-repression). 

Among those repressions, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), defined as the “core region” of Belt and Road Initiative [(Ministry of Commerce of The People’s Republic of China)](http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/i/dxfw/jlyd/201601/20160101243342.shtml), has witnessed ethnic conflicts and systematic repression of Uyghur residents by the Chinese government [(Zenz)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02634937.2018.1507997). With the criticism against China over its repressive practices against Uyghurs in XUAR [(U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23452&LangID=E), the reactions from Muslim-majority states against such measures targeting people sharing their religion may impede and undermine China’s strategic BRI investments regions including Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia. 

This project investigates this question: In terms of both trade figures with China and official stances from states in those regions, how much impact does China’s repressive measures in XUAR against its Muslim citizens had on its diplomatic relations and the execution of BRI projects and investments with those countries?

## Introduction
This project explores China's Belt Road Initiative (BRI) investments in Middle East &amp; North American countries across time. It's created for my final research paper for MODMEST 100: "Introduction to Modern Middle East" at Harvard College.

## Data

This project uses the data published by American Enterprise Institute's [China Global Investment Tracker](http://www.aei.org/china-global-investment-tracker/) dataset. With data until 2019, is the only public dataset on Chinese foreign investment at the time of this project.

The dataset is available for download from CGIT website. It is also included in this repository under the filename `China-Global-Investment-Tracker-2018.xlsx`.

## Visualization

The following are a selections of the visualization and analysis into the CGIT dataset. See `investment_stat.Rmd` for the source code that generated the graphics.
